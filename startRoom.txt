THIS IS A COMBAT DEMO :
 :
Groggy, your eyes flutter open and you behold an unfamiliar room. :
Your head throbs slightly as you try to get your feet under you, :
a brush of your hand behind your head reveals blood from :
a small injury. :

Finally looking around in your strange setting, you note the dismal :
lighting of the semi-circular room in which you find yourself. :
Along the arcing curve of the far wall, you notice five barred gates. :
As you watch the one furthest to your left slowly raises, releasing a :
dark form. As it approaches, you can just barely see the bared teeth :
 and dripping saliva in the failing light around you. :
 
Just before the monster closes with you, it seems to stop, and a voice :
calls out to you from the deep darkness above the reach of the wall :
mounted torches. "Choose thy weapon." it says, and a tablet of stone :
drops down in front of you, marked with a list of weapons. :
